Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

The Spanish slug (Arion vulgaris) is an invasive species that damages crops, outcompetes native slugs, and disrupts ecosystems. It reproduces rapidly, resists many control methods, and thrives in wet climates. It causes significant agricultural loss, contaminates produce, and is a major nuisance in gardens and public spaces. Its spread is worsened by climate change and poses ongoing environmental and economic challenges across Europe.

These extremely slow moving creatures should be easy to detect using AI/computer-vision. One could possibly combine of-the-shelf robotics, such as lawnmovers, cleaning robots and other cheap robots, with a mechanism to pick them up and store in a container for later destruction by a human. 

## Background

The Spanish slug (Arion vulgaris) is an invasive species that damages crops, outcompetes native slugs, and disrupts ecosystems. It reproduces rapidly, resists many control methods, and thrives in wet climates. It causes significant agricultural loss, contaminates produce, and is a major nuisance in gardens and public spaces. Its spread is worsened by climate change and poses ongoing environmental and economic challenges across Europe.

As far as I know, there are no commonly available solutions to remedy this situation. The developments in AI and cheaper robotics could be a solution.


## How is it used?

The users are mainly homeowners and professional gardens.

## Data sources and AI methods

Prototype devices (robots) with cameras can assemble images as first phase. Analysis of the images to spot snails can then be done off-site without performance requirements. The identified pictures can then in a second phase be used as training data for a more performant model to be run directly in the device.

## Challenges

Ethical ways to kill the snails without causing suffering should be used. Care must be done to with a hich confidence separate intrusive snails versus other types of snails.

## What next?

I would like to crowdsource ideas for hardware and software and then run it is a true open-source project, and I'm not able to take lead myself at this time.

## Acknowledgments

Similar idea, but older and uses more expensive hardware:
